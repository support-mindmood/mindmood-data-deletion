# MindMood – Data Deletion

**Local data:**  
In the app, go to **Settings → Factory Reset** to delete all MindMood data stored on your device (journal entries, moods, goals/affirmations, insights history, preferences).

**AI Insights requests:**  
When you tap **Generate AI Insights**, selected fields (e.g., mood, journal text, sleep, alcohol, cigarettes) are sent securely to our processing provider only to return an insight. MindMood does not retain this data on its servers.  
If you believe a specific request was retained by a third-party processor and want it deleted, contact **support@…** with the date/time of the request and we’ll coordinate deletion consistent with our Privacy Policy.

**Contact:** support@…
